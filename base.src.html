<!-- Big text: Framework -->

  # Framework # {#framework}

  ## Infrastructure ## {#framework-infra}

  This document depends on the Infra Standard for a number of foundational concepts used in its
  algorithms and prose [[!INFRA]].

  ## Credentials ## {#framework-credentials}

  From a developer's perspective, a <dfn export id="concept-credential">credential</dfn> is an
  object which allows a developer to make an authentication decision for a particular action. This
  document defines a generic and extensible {{Credential}} interface which serves as a base class
  for [=credentials=] defined in other documents.

  User agents MUST internally provide a <dfn export id="concept-credential-store">credential
  store</dfn>, which is a vendor-specific, opaque storage mechanism that offers the following
  capabilities for [=credential=] access and persistence:

  1.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Store a credential</dfn> for later retrieval.
      This accepts a [=credential=], and inserts it into the [=credential store=].

  2.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Retrieve a list of credentials</dfn>. This
      accepts an arbitrary filter, and returns a `Sequence<Credential>` of those [=credentials=]
      that match the filter.

  3.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Modify a credential</dfn>. This accepts a
      [=credential=], and overwrites the state of an existing [=credential=] in the
      [=credential store=].

  Additionally, the [=credential store=] should maintain a <dfn for="origin">`requires user
  mediation` flag</dfn> for [=origins=] (which is set to `true` unless otherwise specified), and
  offer the following capabilities:

  1.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Retrieve an origin's `requires user
      mediation` flag</dfn>.

  2.  <dfn for="credential store" abstract-op export>Set an origin's `requires user mediation`
      flag</dfn>.

  Note: The importance of user mediation is discussed in more detail in [[#user-mediation]].

  Note: The [=credential store=] is an internal implementation detail of a user agent's
  implementation of the API specified in this document, and is not exposed to the web directly.
  More capabilities may be specified by other documents in support of specific [=credential=]
  types.

  ### The `Credential` Interface ### {#the-credential-interface}

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
    interface Credential {
      readonly attribute USVString id;
      readonly attribute DOMString type;
    };
  </pre>

  <dl dfn-for="Credential">
    :   <dfn attribute>id</dfn>
    ::  The credential's identifier. The requirements for the identifier are distinct for each type
        of [=credential=]. It might represent a username for username/password tuples, for example.

    :   <dfn attribute>type</dfn>
    ::  This attribute's getter returns the value of the object's [=interface object=]'s
        {{[[type]]}} slot, which specifies the kind of credential represented by this object.

    :   <dfn attribute>\[[type]]</dfn>
    ::  The {{Credential}} [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[type]]`, which
        unsurprisingly contains a string representing the type of the credential. The slot's value
        is the empty string unless otherwise specified.

        Note: The {{[[type]]}} slot's value will be the same for all credentials implementing a
        particular interface, which means that developers can rely on `obj.type` returning a string
        that unambigiously represents the specific kind of {{Credential}} they're dealing with.
  </dl>

  ISSUE: Talk to Tobie/Dominic about the [=interface object=] bits, here and in
  [[#algorithm-request]], etc. I'm not sure I've gotten the terminology right. [=interface prototype
  object=], maybe?

  #### `Credential` Internal Methods #### {#credential-internal-methods}

  <section algorithm="'[[Clone]]' internal method">
    {{Credential}} objects are <a>cloneable objects</a>. Each {{Credential}} object's
    <a for="platform object" lt="[[Clone]]()" method>`[[Clone]](targetRealm, memory)`</a> internal method
    will run these steps unless overridden by a subclass:

    Given a [=JavaScript realm=] (|targetRealm|):

    <ul class="algorithm">
      1.  Let |output| be a new {{Credential}} object in |targetRealm|.

      2.  Set |output|'s {{Credential/id}} to <b>this</b>' {{Credential/id}}, and |output|'s
          {{[[type]]}} to <b>this</b>' {{[[type]]}}.

      3.  Return |output|.
    </ul>
  </section>

  The [=interface object=] for {{Credential}} defines three internal methods that allow retrieval and
  storage of {{Credential}} objects:

  <section algorithm="'retrieve a credential' internal method">
    <dfn for="Credential" method export>\[[Retrieve]](options, mediation)</dfn> is called with a
    {{CredentialRequestOptions}} object, and either "`With User Mediation`" or "`Without User
    Mediation`". It returns a {{Credential}} if one can be retrieved from the [=credential store=],
    or `null` otherwise:

    <ul class="algorithm">
      1.  Return `null`.
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section algorithm="'store a credential' internal method">
    <dfn for="Credential" method export>\[[Store]](credential)</dfn> is called with a {{Credential}},
    and returns once {{Credential}} is persisted to the [=credential store=]:

    <ul class="algorithm">
      1.  Return.
    </ul>
  </section>

  Unless otherwise specified, the [=interface objects=] for [=interfaces=] which [=interface/inherit=] from
  {{Credential}} will alias {{Credential}}'s implementation of these three internal methods. Since that
  implementation isn't particularly useful, derived interfaces MUST override one or the other.

  ## Credential Management ## {#framework-credential-management}

  Developers interact with the user agent's [=credential store=] via methods exposed on the
  {{CredentialsContainer}} interface, which hangs off the {{Navigator}} object as
  <a attribute for="Navigator" lt="credentials">`navigator.credentials`</a>.

  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface Navigator {
      [SecureContext] readonly attribute CredentialsContainer credentials;
    };
  </pre>

  Note: As discussed in [[#insecure-sites]], the credential management API is exposed only in
  [=Secure Contexts=].

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
    interface CredentialsContainer {
      Promise&lt;Credential?&gt; get(optional CredentialRequestOptions options);
      Promise&lt;Credential&gt; store(Credential credential);
      Promise&lt;void&gt; requireUserMediation();
    };
  </pre>

  <dl dfn-for="CredentialsContainer">
    :   <dfn method>get()</dfn>
    ::  When {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} is called, the user agent MUST return the result of
        executing <a abstract-op>Request a `Credential`</a> on
        {{CredentialsContainer/get(options)/options}}.

        <pre class="argumentdef" for="CredentialsContainer/get(options)">
          options: The set of properties governing the scope of the request.
        </pre>

    :   <dfn method>store()</dfn>
    ::  When {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} is called, the user agent MUST return the result of
        executing <a abstract-op>Store a `Credential`</a> on 
        {{CredentialsContainer/store(credential)/credential}}.

        <pre class="argumentdef" for="CredentialsContainer/store(credential)">
          credential: The credential to be stored.
        </pre>
    
    :   <dfn method>requireUserMediation()</dfn>
    ::  When {{CredentialsContainer/requireUserMediation()}} is called, the user agent MUST return
        the result of executing <a abstract-op>Require user mediation</a> on the <a>current settings
        object</a>.
  </dl>

  ### The `CredentialRequestOptions` Dictionary ### {#credentialrequestoptions-dictionary}

  In order to retrieve a {{Credential}} via {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}, the caller specifies a
  few parameters in a {{CredentialRequestOptions}} object.

  Note: The {{CredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary is an extension point. If and when new types of
  credentials are introduced that require options, their dictionary types will be added to the
  dictionary so they can be passed into the request. See [[#implementation-extension]].

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
    dictionary CredentialRequestOptions {
      boolean unmediated = false;
    };
  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="CredentialRequestOptions">
    :   <dfn dict-member>unmediated</dfn>
    ::  If `true`, the user agent will only attempt to provide a {{Credential}} without user
        interaction. It MUST NOT present the user with any visible prompt to grant access to a
        {{Credential}}: if the user has opted-into always giving a particular site access to a
        particular set of credentials, they will be provided. If not, the promise will resolve
        with `null`. For processing details, see the algorithm defined in
        [[#algorithm-request]].
  </dl>
</section>

<!-- Big text: Mediation -->
<section>
  # User Mediation # {#user-mediation}

  Exposing credential information to the web via an API has a number of potential impacts on user
  privacy. The user agent, therefore, MUST involve the user in a number of cases in order to ensure
  that they clearly understands what's going on, and with whom their credentials are being shared.

  We call a particular action <dfn export lt="user mediated|user mediation">user mediated</dfn> if
  it takes place after gaining a user's explicit consent. Consent might be expressed through a
  user's direct interaction with a [=credential chooser=] interface, for example. In general, [=user
  mediated=] actions will involve presenting the user some sort of UI, and asking them to make a
  decision.

  An action is <dfn export>unmediated</dfn> if it takes place without explicit user consent. For
  example, if a user configures their browser to grant persistent credential access to a particular
  origin, credentials may be provided without presenting the user with a UI requesting a decision.

  Here we'll spell out a few requirements that hold for all credential types, but note that there's
  a good deal of latitude left up to the user agent (which is in a priviliged position to assist
  the user). Moreover, specific credential types may have distinct requirements that exceed the
  requirements laid out more generally here.

  ## Storing and Updating Credentials ## {#user-mediated-storage}

  Credential information is sensitive data, and users MUST remain in control of that information's
  storage. Inadvertent credential storage could, for instance, unexpectedly link a user's local
  profile on a particular device to a specific online persona. To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  1.  Credential information SHOULD NOT be stored or updated without [=user mediation=]. For
      example, the user agent could display a "Save this credential?" dialog box to the user in
      response to each call to {{store()}}. 

      User consent MAY be inferred if a user agent chooses to offer a persistant grant of consent
      in the form of an "Always save passwords" option (though we'd suggest that user agents should
      err on the side of something more narrowly scoped: perhaps "Always save _generated_
      passwords.", or "Always save passwords for this site.").

  2.  User agents SHOULD notify users when credentials are stored. This might take the form of an
      icon in the address bar, or some similar location.

  3.  User agents MUST allow users to manually remove stored credentials. This functionality might
      be implemented as a settings page, or via interaction with a notification as described above.

  ## Requiring User Mediation ## {#user-mediation-requirement}

  By default, [=user mediation=] is required for all [=origins=], as the relevant [=`require user
  mediation` flag=] in the [=credential store=] is set to `true`. Users MAY choose to grant an
  origin persistent access to credentials (perhaps in the form of a "Stay signed into this site."
  option), which would set this flag to `true`. In this case, the user would always be signed into
  that site, which is desirable from the perspective of usability and convinience, but which
  might nevertheless have surprising implications (consider a user agent which syncs this flag's
  state across devices, for instance).

  To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  1.  User agents MUST allow users to require [=user mediation=] for a given origin or for all
      origins. This functionality might be implemented as a global toggle that overrides the
      [=credential store=]'s <a abstract-op>Retrieve an origin's `requires user mediation`
      flag</a> algorithm to return `false`, or via more granular settings for specific origins
      (or specific credentials on specific origins).

  2.  User agents MUST NOT <a abstract-op>Set an origin's `requires user mediation` flag</a> to
      `false` without [=user mediation=]. For example, the [=credential chooser=] described in
      [[#user-mediated-selection]] could have a checkbox which the user could toggle to mark a
      credential as available without mediation for the origin, or the user agent could have an
      onboarding process for its credential manager which asked a user for a default setting.

  3.  User agents MUST notify users when credentials are provided to an origin. This could take the
      form of an icon in the address bar, or some similar location.

  4.  If a user clears her browsing data for an origin (cookies, localStorage, and so on), the user
      agent MUST <a abstract-op>Set an origin's `requires user mediation` flag</a> to `false` for
      that [=origin=].

  ## Credential Selection ## {#user-mediated-selection}

  When responding to a call to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} on an origin which requires
  [=user mediation=], user agents MUST ask the user for permission to share credential information.
  This SHOULD take the form of a <dfn export>credential chooser</dfn> which presents the user with a
  list of credentials that are available for use on a site, allowing them to select one which should
  be provided to the website, or to reject the request entirely.

  The chooser interface SHOULD be implemented in such a way as to be distinguishable from UI which a
  website could produce. For example, the chooser might overlap the user agent's UI in some
  unspoofable way.

  The chooser interface MUST include an indication of the origin which is requesting credentials.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include all {{Credential}} objects associated with the origin that
  requested credentials.

  <em>The following image is an exceptionally non-normative mock:</em>

  <img src="./mock-chooser.png" alt="A mockup of what a chooser might look like.">

  User agents MAY internally associate information with each {{Credential}} object beyond the
  attributes specified in this document in order to enhance the utility of such a chooser. For
  example, favicons could help disambiguate identity providers, etc. Any additional information
  stored MUST not be exposed directly to the web.

  # Algorithms # {#algorithms}

  <h3 id="algorithm-request" algorithm>Request a `Credential`</h3>

  The <dfn abstract-op>Request a `Credential`</dfn> algorithm accepts a {{CredentialRequestOptions}}
  (|options|), and returns a {{Promise}} which resolves with a {{Credential}} if one can be
  obtained, or with `null` if not.

  <ul class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |settings| be the <a>current settings object</a>

    2.  Assert: |settings| is a [=secure context=].

    3.  Return a {{Promise}} rejected with `NotSupportedError` if any of the following statements
        are true:

        1.  |settings| does not have a [=environment settings object/responsible document=].

        2.  |settings|' [=environment settings object/responsible document=] is not the
            [=active document=] in a [=top-level browsing context=].

    4.  Let |retriever| be `null`.

    5.  For each |key| in |options|' <a for="map" lt="get the keys">keys</a>:

        1.  Let |credential interfaces| be the set of [=interfaces=] whose [=inherited interfaces=]
            <a for="set">contain</a> {{Credential}}.

        2.  For each |interface| in |credential interfaces|:

            1.  If |interface|'s [=interface object=]'s {{[[type]]}} slot's value is not |key|,
                <a for="iteration">continue</a>.

            2.  Let |interface retriever| be |interface|'s {{[[Retrieve]](options, mediation)}}
                internal method.

            3.  If |retriever| is neither `null` nor |interface retriever|, return a new {{Promise}}
                rejected with `TypeMismatchError`.

            4.  Set |retriever| to |interface retriever|.

        Note: The goal here is to walk through all the known types of credentials, comparing them
        to the keys in |options| to figure out which {{[[Retrieve]]()}} method we'll use to poke at
        the [=credential store=]. If the developer requests multiple types, we verify that they're
        implemented using the same {{[[Retrieve]]()}} method. If so, great! If not, we error out.

    6.  Let |p| be a new {{Promise}}.
    
    7.  Return |p|, and execute the following steps asynchronously:

    8.  Let |c| be the result of executing |retriever| on |options| and "`Without User Mediation`".

    9.  If |c| is not `null`, resolve |p| with |c|, and skip the remaining steps.

    10. If |options|' {{CredentialRequestOptions/unmediated}} is `true`, resolve |p| with `null` and
        skip the remaining steps.

    11. Resolve |p| with the result of executing |retriever| on |options| and "`With User
        Mediation`".
  </ul>

  <h3 id="algorithm-store" algorithm>Store a `Credential`</h3>

  The <dfn abstract-op>Store a `Credential`</dfn> algorithm accepts a {{Credential}}
  (|credential|), and returns a {{Promise}} which resolves once the object is persisted to the

  <ul class="algorithm">

    2.  Assert: |settings| is a [=secure context=].

        are true:

        1.  |settings| does not have a [=environment settings object/responsible document=].

        2.  |settings|' [=environment settings object/responsible document=] is not the

    4.  Return a {{Promise}} which resolves with the result of executing |credential|'s
        [=interface object=]'s {{[[Store]](credential)}} internal method on |credential|.
  </ul>

  <h3 id="algorithm-require-mediation" algorithm>Require User Mediation</h3>

  The <dfn abstract-op>Require user mediation</dfn> algorithm accepts an [=environment settings

  flag is persisted to the [=credential store=].

  <ul class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |origin| be |settings|' [=environment settings object/origin=].

    2.  Let |p| be a new {{Promise}}.

  # Security and Privacy Considerations # {#security-and-privacy}

  ## Credential Leakage ## {#security-leakage}

  Credentials are sensitive information, and user agents need to exercise caution in determining
  when they can be safely shared with a website. Likewise, developers would be well-advised to take
  some precautions to mitigate the risk that a cross-site scripting attack could turn into
  persistent access to a user's account by by setting a reasonable Content Security Policy [[!CSP]]
  which restricts the endpoints to which data can be sent. In particular, developers should ensure
  that the following directives are set, explicitly or implicitly, in their pages' policies:

  *   <a>`script-src`</a> and <a>`object-src`</a> both restrict script execution on a page, making
      it less likely that a cross-site scripting attack will succeed in the first place.

  *   <a>`connect-src`</a> restricts the origins to which {{fetch()}} may submit data (which
      mitigates the risk that credentials could be exfiltrated to `evil.com`.

  *   <a>`child-src`</a> restricts the nested browsing contexts which may be embedded in a page,
      making it more difficult to inject a malicious `postMessage()` target. [[WEBMESSAGING]]

  Developers should, of course, also properly escape input and output, and consider using other
  layers of defense, such as Subresource Integrity [[SRI]] to further reduce risk.

  When defining specific credential types, specific credential types SHOULD give due consideration
  to the ways in which credential data can be transmitted over the wire. It might be reasonable,
  for example, to define transmission mechanisms which are restricted to same-origin endpoints.

  ## Insecure Sites ## {#insecure-sites}

  User agents MUST NOT expose the APIs defined here to environments which are not [=secure
  contexts=]. User agents might implement autofill mechanisms which store user credentials and fill
  sign-in forms on non-<a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated URLs</a>, but those sites cannot
  be trusted to interact directly with the credential manager in any meaningful way, and those sites
  MUST NOT have access to credentials saved in [=secure contexts=].

  ## Origin Confusion ## {#security-origin-confusion}

  If framed pages have access to the APIs defined here, it might be possible to confuse a user into
  granting access to credentials for an origin other than the <a>top-level browsing context</a>,
  which is the only security origin which users can reasonably be expected to understand.

  Therefore, both {{get()}} and {{store()}} will result in a rejected {{Promise}} when called from
  a [=nested browsing context=], and the API and related interfaces are not exposed inside
  {{Worker}} contexts.

  The algorithms in [[#algorithm-request]] and [[#algorithm-store]] contain more detail.

  ## Timing Attacks ## {#security-timing}

  If the user has no credentials for an origin, a call to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} will
  resolve very quickly indeed. A malicious website could distinguish between a user with no
  credentials and a user with credentials who chooses not to share them.

  User agents SHOULD also rate-limit credential requests. It's almost certainly abusive for a page
  to request credentials more than a few times in a short period.

  ## Signing-Out ## {#security-signout}

  If a user has chosen to automatically sign-in to websites, as discussed in
  [[#user-mediation-requirement]], then the user agent will provide credentials to an origin
  whenever it asks for them. The website can instruct the user agent to suppress this behavior by
  calling {{CredentialsContainer}}'s {{CredentialsContainer/requireUserMediation()}} method, which
  will turn off automatic sign-in for a given origin.

  The user agent relies on the website to do the right thing; an inattentive (or malicious) website
  could simply neglect to call this method, causing the user agent to continue providing credentials
  against the user's apparent intention. This is marginally worse than the status-quo of a site that
  doesn't clear user credentials when they click "Sign-out", as the user agent becomes complicit in
  the authentication.

  The user MUST have some control over this behavior. As noted in [[#user-mediation-requirement]],
  clearing cookies for an origin will also reset that origin's [=`requires user mediation` flag=] in
  the [=credential store=] to `true`. Additionally, the user agent SHOULD provide some UI affordance
  for disabling automatic sign-in for a particular origin. This could be tied to the notification
  that credentials have been provided to an origin, for example.

  ## Chooser Leakage ## {#security-chooser-leakage}

  If a user agent's [=credential chooser=] displays images supplied by an origin (for example, if a
  {{Credential}} displays a site's favicon), then, requests for these images MUST NOT be directly
  tied to instantiating the chooser in order to avoid leaking chooser usage. One option would be to
  fetch the images in the background when saving or updating a {{Credential}}, and to cache them for
  the lifetime of the {{Credential}}.

  These images MUST be fetched with the [=request/credentials mode=] set to "`omit`", the
  [=request/service-workers mode=] set to "`none`", the [=request/client=] set to `null`, the
  [=request/initiator=] set to the empty string, and the [=request/destination=] "`subresource`".

  Moreover, if the user agent allows the user to change either the name or icon associated with the
  credential, the alterations to the data SHOULD NOT be exposed to the website (consider a user who
  names two credentials for an origin "My fake account" and "My real account", for instance).

  ## Locally Stored Data ## {#security-local-data}

  This API offers an [=origin=] the ability to store data persistently along with a user's profile.
  Since most user agents treat credential data differently than "browsing data" (cookies, etc.)
  this might have the side effect of surprising a user who might believe that all traces of an
  origin have been wiped out when they clear their cookies.

  User agents SHOULD provide UI that makes it clear to a user that credential data is stored for an
  origin, and SHOULD make it easy for users to remove such data when they're no longer interested in
  keeping it around.

  ISSUE(w3c/webappsec#290): Add some thoughts here about when and how the API
  should be used, especially with regard to {{unmediated}}.

  ## Extension Points ## {#implementation-extension}

  This document provides a generic, high-level API that's meant to be extended with specific types
  of [=credentials=] that serve specific authentication needs. Doing so is, hopefully,
  straightforward:

  1.  Define a new interface that inherits from {{Credential}}:
 
      <div class="example"> 
        <pre>
          [Constructor(...),
           Exposed=Window,
           SecureContext]
          interface ExampleCredential : Credential {
            // Definition goes here.
          };
        </pre>
      </div>

  2.  Define {{[[Retrieve]](options, mediation)}} and {{[[Store]](credential)}} internal
      methods on `ExampleCredential`'s [=interface object=]:

      <div class="example">
        `ExampleCredential`'s `[[Retrieve]](options, mediation)` internal method is called
        with a CredentialRequestOptions object (`options`), and either "`With User Mediation`" or
        "`Without User Mediation`". It returns a `Credential` if one can be retrieved from the
        credential store, or `null` otherwise:

        1.  Return a new `Promise` `p`, and execute the remaining steps asynchronously.

        2.  Let `c` be a new `ExampleCredential` with its properties set as follows:
        
            * ...

        3.  Resolve `p` with `c`.
      </div>

  3.  Define the value of the `ExampleCredential` [=interface object=]'s {{[[type]]}} slot:

      <div class="example">
        The `ExampleCredential` [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[type]]` whose
        value is the string "`example`".
      </div>

  4.  Extend {{CredentialRequestOptions}} with the options the new credential type needs to respond
      reasonably to {{get()}}:

      <div class="example">
        <pre>
          dictionary ExampleCredentialRequestOptions {
            // Definition goes here.
          };

          partial dictionary CredentialRequestOptions {
            ExampleCredentialRequestOptions? example;
          };
        </pre>
      </div>

  You might also find that new primitives are necessary. For instance, you might want to return
  many {{Credential}} objects rather than just one in some sort of complicated, multi-factor
  sign-in process. That might be accomplished in a generic fashion by adding a `getAll()` method to
  {{CredentialsContainer}} which returned a `sequence<Credential>`, and defining a reasonable
  mechanism for dealing with requesting credentials of distinct types.

  For any such extension, we recommend getting in touch with
  <a href="mailto:public-webappsec@w3.org">public-webappsec@</a> for consultation and review.

  ## Browser Extensions ## {#browser-extensions}

  Ideally, user agents that implement an extension system of some sort will
  allow third-parties to hook into these API endpoints in order to improve
  the behavior of third party credential management software in the same way
  that user agents can improve their own via this imperative approach.

  This could range from a complex new API that the user agent mediates, or
  simply by allowing extensions to overwrite the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}
  and {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} endpoints for their own purposes.
