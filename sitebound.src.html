  # Introduction # {#intro}

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Signing into websites is more difficult than it should be. The user agent is in a unique position
  to improve the experience in a number of ways, and most modern user agents have recognized this by
  providing some measure of credential management natively in the browser. Users can save usernames
  and passwords for websites, and those [=credentials=] are autofilled into sign-in forms with
  varying degrees of success.

  The <{input/autocomplete}> attribute offers a declarative mechanism by which websites can work
  with user agents to improve the latter's ability to detect and fill sign-in forms by marking
  specific fields as "`username`" or "`current-password`", and user agents implement a wide variety
  of detection heuristics to work with websites which haven't taken the time to provide this detail
  in markup.

  While this combination of heuristic and declarative detection works relatively well, the status
  quo leaves some large gaps where detection is problematic. Sites with uncommon sign-in mechanisms
  (submitting credentials via {{XMLHttpRequest}} [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]], for instance) are difficult to
  reliably detect, as is the increasingly common case in which users wish to authenticate themselves
  using a federated identity provider. Allowing websites to more directly interact with the user
  agent's credential manager would allow the credential manager to be more accurate on the one hand,
  and to assist users with federated sign-in on the other.

  To that end, this document defines an extension to the Credential Management API
  [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]], creating {{PasswordCredential}} and {{FederatedCredential}}
  interfaces that give developers imperative access to the user agent's [=credential store=].

  Note: The API defined here is intentionally small and simple: it does not intend to provide
  authentication in and of itself, but is limited to providing an interface to the existing
  credential managers implemented by existing user agents. That functionality is valuable _right
  now_, without significant effort on the part of either vendors or authors. There's certainly quite
  a bit more which could be done, of course. See [[#future-work]] for some thoughts we've punted for
  now, but which could be explored in future iterations of this API.

  ## Examples ## {#examples}

  ### Password-based Sign-in ### {#examples-password-signin}

  A website that supports only username/password pairs can request credentials, and use them with
  existing sign-in endpoints:

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="get()" for="CredentialsContainer">get</a>({ "<a for="CredentialRequestOptions" dict-member>password</a>": true }).then(
          function(credential) {
            if (!credential) {
              // The user either doesn't have credentials for this site, or
              // refused to share them. Insert some code here to fall back to
              // a basic login form (or, ideally, do nothing, since this API
              // should really be progressive enhancement on top of an
              // existing form).
              return;
            }
            if (credential.type == "<a const>password</a>") {
              fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" })
                .then(function (response) {
                  if (/* |response| indicates a successful login */) {
                    // Store the credential again, see note below.
                    navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="store()" for="CredentialsContainer">store</a>(credential);
                    // Notify the user that sign-in succeeded! Do amazing, signed-in things!
                  } else {
                    // Insert some code here to fall back to a basic login form.
                  }
                });
            } else {
              // See <a href="#examples-federated-signin">the Federated Sign-in example</a>
            }
          });
    </pre>

    Note: The [=credential chooser=] presented by the user agent could allow the user to choose
    credentials that aren't actually stored for the current origin. For instance, it might offer up
    redentials from `https://m.example.com` when signing into `https://www.example.com` (as
    described in [[#security-cross-origin-leakage]]), or it might allow a user to create a new
    credential on the fly. Developers can deal gracefully with this uncertainty by calling
    {{CredentialsContainer/store()}} every time credentials are successfully used, even right after
    credentials have been retrieved from {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}: if the credentials aren't
    yet stored for the origin, the user will be given the opportunity to do so. If they are stored,
    the user won't be prompted.
  </div>

  ## Federated Sign-in ## {#examples-federated-signin}

  A website that supports federated identity providers as well as passwords can request credentials,
  and use them to kick off the sign-in flow for the user's chosen provider:

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="get()" for="CredentialsContainer">get</a>({
        "<a for="CredentialRequestOptions" dict-member>password</a>": true,
        "<a dict-member>federated</a>": {
          "<a idl>providers</a>": [ "https://www.facebook.com", "https://accounts.google.com" ]
        }
      }).then(
          function(credential) {
            if (!credential)
              return;

            if (credential.type == "<a const>federated</a>") {
              switch (credential.<a idl for="FederatedCredential">provider</a>) {
              case "https://www.facebook.com/":
                // Use Facebook's SDK, a la
                // <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/#logindialog">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/#logindialog</a>
                FB.login(function (response) {
                  if (response.status === "authorized") {
                    // Can now use FB.api() calls
                  } else {
                    // Explain to the user that we would really like them to
                    // click "Log me in".
                  }
                });
                break;

              case "https://accounts.google.com/":
                // Ditto
                break;

              // ...
              }
            } else {
              fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" })
                .then(function (response) { ... })
                .catch(function (response) { ... });
            }
          });
    </pre>

    Note: This API does not go out to the identity provider to grab a token, or authenticate the
    user in any way. It provides a hint to the website as to which identity provider the user
    prefers to use, and little more. See [[#future-work]] for directions future versions of this
    API could take.
  </div>

  ## Post-sign-in Confirmation ## {#examples-post-signin}

  To ensure that users are offered to store new credentials after a successful sign-in, they need
  to be passed to {{CredentialsContainer/store()}}.

  <div class="example">
    If a user is signed in by calling {{fetch()}} on a {{PasswordCredential}} object, submitting
    that data to a sign-in endpoint, then we can check the response to determine whether the user
    was signed in successfully, and notify the user agent accordingly. Given a sign-in form like the
    following:

    <pre>
      &lt;form action="https://example.com/login" method="POST" id="theForm"&gt;
        &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>username</a>"&gt;
        &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>current-password</a>"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

    Then the developer can handle the form submission with something like the following handler:

    <pre>
      document.querySelector('#theForm').addEventListener("submit", e =&gt; {
          if (<a attribute lt="credentials">navigator.credentials</a>) {
            e.preventDefault();

            // Construct a new <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> from the <a idl>HTMLFormElement</a>
            // that fired the "submit" event: this will suck up the values of the fields
            // labeled with "username" and "current-password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>
            // attributes:
            var c = new <a idl lt="PasswordCredential(form)">PasswordCredential</a>(e.target);

            // Fetch the form's action URL, passing that new credential object in
            // as the fetch's credentials. If the response indicates success, ask
            // the user agent to ask the user to store the credential for future use:
            var init = { method: "POST", credentials: c };
            fetch(e.target.action, init).then(r =&gt; {
              if (/* |r| is a "successful" <a idl>Response</a> */)
                <a idl lt="store()">navigator.credentials.store</a>(c);
            });
          }
      });
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    If we're using a <a>federated identity provider</a>:

    <pre>
      if (<a attribute lt="credentials">navigator.credentials</a>) {
        navigator.<a attribute>credentials</a>.<a idl lt="store()">store</a>(
          new <a idl>FederatedCredential</a>({
            "<a idl for="CredentialData">id</a>": "username",
            "<a idl for="FederatedCredentialData">provider</a>": "https://federation.com"
          })
        );
      }
    </pre>
  </div>

  ## Change Password ## {#examples-change-password}

  This same storage mechanism can be reused for "password change" with no modifications: if the
  user changes their credentials, the website can notify the user agent that they've successfully
  signed in with new credentials. The user agent can then update the credentials it stores:

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. allows users to change their passwords by POSTing data to
    a backend server asynchronously. After doing so successfully, they can
    update the user's credentials by calling {{CredentialsContainer/store()}}
    with the new information.

    Given a password change form like the following:

    <pre>
      &lt;form action="https://example.com/changePassword" method="POST" id="theForm"&gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" name="username" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>username</a>" value="user"&gt;
        &lt;label for="password"&gt;New Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>="<a attr-value>new-password</a>"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

    The developer can handle the form submission with something like the following:

    <pre>
      document.querySelector('#theForm').addEventListener("submit", e =&gt; {
        if (<a attribute lt="credentials">navigator.credentials</a>) {
          e.preventDefault();

          // Construct a new <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> from the <a idl>HTMLFormElement</a>
          // that fired the "submit" event: this will suck up the values of the fields
          // labeled with "username" and "new-password" <a element-attr for="input">autocomplete</a>
          // attributes:
          var c = new <a idl lt="PasswordCredential(form)">PasswordCredential</a>(e.target);

          // Fetch the form's action URL, passing that new credential object in
          // as the fetch's credentials. If the response indicates success, ask
          // the user agent to ask the user to store the credential for future use:
          var init = { method: "POST", credentials: c };
          fetch(e.target.action, init).then(r =&gt; {
            if (/* |r| is a "successful" <a idl>Response</a> */)
              <a idl lt="store()">navigator.credentials.store</a>(c);
          });
        }
      });
    </pre>
  </div>

  ## Layering on top of a legacy system ## {#examples-legacy}

  The API is designed in such a way as to cleanly sit on top of an existing password-based sign-in
  system's backend. For instance, the username and password parameters can be renamed by adjusting
  the {{PasswordCredential}}'s {{PasswordCredential/idName}} and {{PasswordCredential/passwordName}}
  attributes, and additional data can be added to a request by setting the
  {{PasswordCredential/additionalData}} attribute.

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. has an existing sign-in system that expects the username to be submitted as a
    parameter named "`u`" and a the password as a parameter named "`p`". The following code
    accomplishes this:

    <pre>
      // Given a <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> |credential|:
      credential.idName = "u";
      credential.passwordName = "p";
      fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" });
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Further, MegaCorp Inc. protects itself against attack by appending a CSRF token to the request.
    The following code accomplishes this:

    <pre>
      // Given a <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> |credential|:
      credential.<a idl>additionalData</a> = new FormData();
      credential.<a idl>additionalData</a>.append("csrf", "[random token value goes here]");
      
      fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" });
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc.'s backend servers cannot accept POST requests submitted as `multipart/form-data`.
    They need to submit the credential information as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` instead.
    They can accomplish this by setting the {{PasswordCredential/additionalData}} attribute to a
    {{URLSearchParams}} object (which serializes as a urlencoded submission):

    <pre>
      // Given a <a idl>PasswordCredential</a> |credential|:
      credential.<a idl>additionalData</a> = new URLSearchParams();
      
      // Note that MegaCorp Inc. doesn't need to append any data to the
      // object. Setting `additionalData` to an empty `URLSearchParams` object
      // is enough to change the content type of the submission.
      
      fetch("https://example.com/loginEndpoint", { credentials: credential, method: "POST" });
    </pre>
  </div>

  # Framework # {#framework}

  This document extends the Credential Management API by adding two new types of [=credential=]
  objects, {{PasswordCredential}} and {{FederatedCredential}}, both inheriting from a
  {{SiteBoundCredential}} which contains some shared logic.

  ## The `SiteBoundCredential` Interface ## {#siteboundcredential-interface}

  The {{SiteBoundCredential}} inteface inherits from {{Credential}}, and serves as a base class for
  both {{PasswordCredential}} and {{FederatedCredential}}:

  <pre class="idl">
    [Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
    interface SiteBoundCredential : Credential {
      readonly attribute USVString name;
      readonly attribute USVString iconURL;
    };

    dictionary SiteBoundCredentialData : CredentialData {
      USVString name;
      USVString iconURL;
    };
  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="SiteBoundCredential">
    :   <dfn attribute>name</dfn>
    ::  A human-readable name associated with a credential, suitable for display in a [=credential
        chooser=] to allow a user to disambiguate several [=credentials=] for an [=origin=].

    :   <dfn attribute>iconURL</dfn>
    ::  A URL, pointing to an image for the credential, also suitable for display in a [=credential
        chooser=]. The URL MUST be an <a><i lang="la">a priori</i> authenticated URL</a>.

        ISSUE(w3c/webappsec#247): Anne suggests that this might be better modeled as an
        `ImageBitmap` or `blob:`. We also need to figure out responsiveness. Perhaps
        [[APPMANIFEST]]'s format?

    :   <dfn attribute>\[[type]]</dfn>
    ::  The {{SiteBoundCredential}} [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[type]]` whose
        value is the empty string.

    :   <dfn attribute>\[[origin]]</dfn>
    ::  Each {{SiteBoundCredential}} object has an internal slot named `[[origin]]` whose value is
        [=origin=] for which the [=credential=] is valid. This property is not directly exposed to
        the web.
  </dl>

  {{SiteBoundCredential}}'s [=interface object=] defines two internal methods that override
  {{Credential}}'s implementation:

  <dfn for="SiteBoundCredential" method>\[[Retrieve]](options, mediation)</dfn> is defined in
  [[#request-credential]].

  <dfn for="SiteBoundCredential" method>\[[Store]](credential)</dfn> is defined in
  [[#store-credential]].

  ## The `PasswordCredential` Interface ## {#passwordcredential-interface}

  <pre class="idl">
    typedef (FormData or URLSearchParams) CredentialBodyType;

    [Constructor(PasswordCredentialData data),
     Constructor(HTMLFormElement form),
     Exposed=Window,
     SecureContext]
    interface PasswordCredential : SiteBoundCredential {
      attribute USVString idName;
      attribute USVString passwordName;

      attribute CredentialBodyType? additionalData;
    };

    [Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
    dictionary PasswordCredentialData : SiteBoundCredentialData {
      required USVString password;
    };
  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="PasswordCredential">
    :   <dfn attribute>idName</dfn>
    ::  This attribute represents the name which will be used for the ID field when submitting the
        {{PasswordCredential}} to a remote endpoint via {{fetch()}}. It defaults to "`username`",
        but can be overridden by a developer to match whatever the backend service expects.

    :   <dfn attribute>passwordName</dfn>
    ::  This attribute represents the name which will be used for the ID field when submitting the
        {{PasswordCredential}} to a remote endpoint via {{fetch()}}. It defaults to "`password`",
        but can be overridden by a developer to match whatever the backend service expects.

    :   <dfn attribute>additionalData</dfn>
    ::  If the developer wishes to specify additional data to insert into the request body when
        submitting the credential information to a remote endpoint, they can do so by assigning a
        {{FormData}} or {{URLSearchParams}} object to this attribute. The credential information
        will be mixed into the object to produce the body. The value is `null` unless otherwise
        specified.

    :   <dfn attribute>\[[type]]</dfn>
    ::  The {{PasswordCredential}} [=interface object=] has an internal slot named `[[type]]` whose
        value is "`password`".

    :   <dfn attribute>\[[password]]</dfn>
    ::  Each {{PasswordCredential}} object has an internal slot named `[[password]]` which stores
        the credential's password. This property is not directly exposed to the web, but used to
        construct a request body during {{fetch()}}.

    :   <dfn constructor>PasswordCredential(form)</dfn>
    ::  This constructor is defined in [[#construct-passwordcredential-form]].

    :   <dfn constructor>PasswordCredential(data)</dfn>
    ::  This constructor is defined in [[#construct-passwordcredential-data]].
  </dl>

  {{PasswordCredential}}'s [=interface object=] contains two internal methods:

  ### Identifying Providers ### {#provider-identification}

  Every site should use the same identifier when referring to a specific federated identity
  provider. For example,
  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/v2.0">Facebook Login</a>
  shouldn't be referred to as "Facebook" and "Facebook Login" and "FB" and "FBL" and "Facebook.com"
  and so on. It should have a canonical identifier which everyone can make use of, as consistent
  identification makes it possible for user agents to be helpful.

  For consistency, federations passed into the APIs defined in this document (e.g.
  {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions}}'s {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} array, or
  {{FederatedCredential}}'s {{FederatedCredential/provider}} property) MUST be identified by the
  <a lt="ASCII serialization of an origin">ASCII serialization</a> of the origin the provider uses
  for sign in. That is, Facebook would be represented by `https://www.facebook.com` and Google by
  `https://accounts.google.com`.

  This serialization of an [=origin=] does _not_ include a trailing U+002F SOLIDUS ("`/`"), but
  user agents SHOULD accept them silently: `https://accounts.google.com/` is clearly
  intended to be the same as `https://accounts.google.com`.

  ## `CredentialRequestOptions` Extension ## {#credentialrequestoptions-extension}

  Each credential type also extends {{CredentialRequestOptions}} to support
  {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}:

  <pre class="idl">
    dictionary FederatedCredentialRequestOptions {
      sequence&lt;USVString&gt; providers;
      sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; protocols;
    };

    [Exposed=Window, SecureContext]
    partial dictionary CredentialRequestOptions {
      boolean password = false;
      FederatedCredentialRequestOptions? federated;
    };

  <h4 algorithm id="request-credential">
    Request a `SiteBoundCredential`
  </h4>

  {{SiteBoundCredential}}'s {{SiteBoundCredential/[[Retrieve]](options, mediation)}} internal
  method is called with a {{CredentialRequestOptions}} object (|options|), and either
  "`With User Mediation`" or "`Without User Mediation`" (|mediation|). It returns a
  {{SiteBoundCredential}} if one can be retrieved from the [=credential store=], or `null`
  otherwise:

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |origin| be the [=environment settings object/origin=] of the
        [=current settings object=].

    2.  <a abstract-op>Retrieve an origin's `requires user mediation` flag</a> from the
        [=credential store=] for |origin|, and set |require mediation| to its value.

    3.  If |require mediation| is `true` and |mediation| is "`Without User Mediation`", return
        `null`.

        Note: If a user agent implements a "private browsing" mode, we recommend that this algorithm
        always return `null` when "private browsing mode" is activated and |mediation| is
        "`Without User Mediation`".

    4.  <a abstract-op>Retrieve a list of credentials</a> from the [=credential store=] which
        represent {{SiteBoundCredential}} objects whose {{SiteBoundCredential/[[origin]]}} is the
        <a>same origin</a> as |origin|. Let |list| be the result.

    5.  If |options| does not have a {{CredentialRequestOptions/password}} member whose value is
        `true`, remove all {{PasswordCredential}} objects from |list|.

    6.  If |options| does not have a {{CredentialRequestOptions/federated}} member, remove all
        {{FederatedCredential}} objects from |list|.

    7.  If |options| has a {{CredentialRequestOptions/federated}} member (|federated options|),
        then:

        1.  For each |credential| in |list|, remove |credential| from |list| _unless_ one or more
            of the following statements is true:

            *   |credential|'s {{FederatedCredential/provider}} is <a for="list">contained</a> in
                |federated options| {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/providers}} member's value.

            *   |credential|'s {{FederatedCredential/protocol}} is <a for="list">contained</a> in
                |federated options| {{FederatedCredentialRequestOptions/protocols}} member's value.

        Otherwise, remove all {{FederatedCredential}} objects from |list|.

    8.  If |mediation| is "`Without User Mediation`":

        1.  Assert: |require mediation| is `false`.

        2.  If |list|'s <a for="list">size</a> is 1, then return |list|[0].

        3.  Return `null`.

    9.  Present the user with a [=credential chooser=], using |list| as a data source.

        Note: This behavior is vendor-specific and unspecified outside the guidelines enumerated
        in the dicussion of [=credential choosers=] in [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]].

    10. Return the {{SiteBoundCredential}} the user chose, or `null` if the user
        declined to share a credential.

            1.  If the user grants permission to update credentials (as discussed in

  # Security and Privacy Considerations # {#security-and-privacy}

  ## Cross-origin Credential Leakage ## {#security-cross-origin-leakage}

  Credentials are sensitive information, and user agents need to exercise caution in determining
  when they can be safely shared with a website. The safest option is to restrict credential
  sharing to the exact origin on which they were saved. That is likely too restrictive for the
  web, however: consider sites which divide functionality into subdomains like `example.com` vs
  `admin.example.com`.

  As a compromise between annoying users, and securing their credentials, user agents:

  1.  MUST NOT share credentials between origins whose scheme components represent a downgrade in
      security. That is, it may make sense to allow credentials saved on `http://example.com/` to
      be made available to `https://example.com/` (in order to encourage developers to migrate to
      secure transport), but the inverse would be dangerous.

  2.  MAY use the Public Suffix List [[!PSL]] to determine the effective scope of a credential by
      comparing the [=registerable domain=] of the credential's {{[[origin]]}} with the origin in
      which {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} is called. That is: credentials saved on
      `https://admin.example.com/` and `https://example.com/` MAY be offered to users when
      {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} is called from `https://www.example.com/`, and vice versa.

  3.  MUST NOT offer credentials to an origin in response to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} without
      [=user mediation=] if the credential's origin is not an exact match for the calling origin.
      That is, {{Credential}} objects for `https://example.com` would not be returned directly to
      `https://www.example.com`, but could be offered to the user via the chooser.

  {{PasswordCredential}}s further mitigate the risk of data leakage by never exposing the
  {{[[password]]}} slot directly to a page's JavaScript, but only allowing its submission to a
  same-origin server-side endpoint via {{fetch()}}.

  # Future Work # {#future-work}

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The API defined here does the bare minimum to expose user agent's credential managers to the web,
  and allows the web to help those credential managers understand when federated identity providers
  are in use. The next logical step will be along the lines sketched in documents like [[WEB-LOGIN]]
  (and, to some extent, Mozilla's BrowserID [[BROWSERID]]).

  The user agent is in the unique position of being able to effectively mediate the relationship
  between users, identity providers, and websites. If the user agent can remove some of the risk and
  confusion associated with the typical authentication flows, users will be in a significantly
  better position than today.

  A natural way to expose this information might be to extend the {{FederatedCredential}} interface
  with properties like authentication tokens, and possibly to add some form of manifest format with
  properties that declare the authentication type which the provider supports.

  The API described here is designed to be extensible enough to support use cases that require user
  interaction, perhaps with websites other than the one which requested credentials. We hope that
  the {{Promise}}-based system we've settled on is extensible enough to support these kinds of
  asynchronous flows which could require some level of interaction between multiple browsing
  contexts (e.g. mediated activity on `idp.com` might resolve a {{Promise}} handed back to `rp.com`)
  in the future without redesigning the API from the ground up.

  Baby steps.
