  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Signing into websites is more difficult than it should be. The user agent is
  in a unique position to improve the experience in a number of ways, and most
  modern user agents have recognized this by providing some measure of
  credential management natively in the browser. Users can save usernames and
  passwords for websites, and those <a>credentials</a> are autofilled into
  sign-in forms with varying degrees of success.

  The <code><a element-attr>autocomplete</a></code> attribute offers a
  declarative mechanism by which websites can work with user agents to improve
  the latter's ability to detect and fill sign-in forms by marking specific
  fields as "username" or "password", and user agents implement a wide variety
  of detection heuristics to work with websites which haven't taken the time to
  provide this detail in markup.

  While this combination of heuristic and declarative detection works relatively
  well, the status quo leaves some large gaps where detection is problematic.
  Sites with uncommon sign-in mechanisms (submitting credentials via
  XMLHttpRequest [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]], for instance) are difficult to reliably
  detect, as is the increasingly common case in which users wish to authenticate
  themselves using a <a>federated identity provider</a>. Allowing websites to
  more directly interact with the user agent's credential manager would allow
  the credential manager to be more accurate on the one hand, and to assist
  users with federated sign-in on the other.

  These use cases are explored in more detail in [[#use-cases]] and in
  <a href="../usecases/">Credential Management: Use Cases and Requirements</a>;
  this specification attempts to address many of the requirements that document
  outlines by defining a Credential Manager API which a website can use to
  request <a>credentials</a> for a user, and to notify the user agent that the
  user successfully signed in, failed to sign in, or signed out.

  Note: The API defined here is intentionally small and simple: it does not
  intend to provide authentication in and of itself, but is limited to providing
  an interface to the existing credential managers implemented by existing user
  agents. That functionality is valuable <em>right now</em>, without significant
  effort on the part of either vendors or authors. There's certainly quite a bit
  more which could be done, of course. See [[#future-work]] for some thoughts
  we've punted for now, but which could be explored in future iterations of this
  API.

  <section>
    <h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

    Modern user agents generally offer users the capability to save passwords
    when signing into a website, and likewise offer the capability to fill those
    passwords into sign-in forms fully- or semi-automatically when users return
    to a website. From the perspective of a website, this behavior is completely
    invisible: the website doesn't know that passwords have been stored, and it
    isn't notified that passwords have been filled. This is both good and bad.
    On the one hand, a user agent's password manager works regardless of whether
    or not a site cooperates, which is excellent for users. On the other, the
    password managers' behaviors are a fragile and proprietary hodgepodge of
    heuristics meant to detect and fill sign-in forms, password change forms,
    and etc.

    A few problems with the status quo stand out as being particularly
    problematic:

    <ul>
      <li>
        User agents have an incredibly difficult time helping users with
        federated identity providers. While detecting a username/password
        form submission is fairly straightforward, detecting sign-in via a
        third-party is quite difficult to reliably do well. It would be nice
        if a website could help the user agent understand the intent behind the
        redirects associated with a typical federated sign-in action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Likewise, user agents struggle to detect more esoteric sign-in
        mechanisms than simple username/password forms. Authors increasingly
        asynchronously sign users in via XMLHttpRequest or similar mechanisms
        in order to improve the experience and take more control over the
        presentation. This is good for users, but tough for user agents to
        integrate into their password managers. It would be nice if a website
        could help the user agent make sense of the sign-in mechanism they
        choose to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        While signing into a website with a username and password is fairly well
        supported, creating a new account on a website is more or less left up
        to the user. The user agent has a good deal of information which could
        help the user create an account, of course: for instance, it knows
        whether the user has stored passwords for federated identity providers
        which the website might support, it could help the user fill in commonly
        used elements like email addresses, and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, changing passwords is less well-suppported than it could be if
        the website explicitly informed the user agent that credentials had
        changed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="introduction-examples">Examples</h3>

    <h4 id="examples-local-signin">Local Sign-in</h4>

    A website that supports only username/password pairs can request
    credentials, and use them in existing sign-in forms:

    <div class="example">
      <pre>
        if (!navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>) {
          // Sadness! Return early.
          return;
        }

        navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl>request()</a>.then(
            function(credential) {
              if (!credential) {
                // The user either doesn't have credentials for this site, or
                // refused to share them. Insert some code here to show a basic
                // login form (or, ideally, do nothing, since this API should
                // really be progressive enhancement on top of an existing form).
                return;
              }

              var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
              xhr.open("POST", "https://example.com/loginEndpoint");
              xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
                if (this.readyState != this.DONE)
                  return;

                var loginSucceeded = // Process response: if login succeeded, yay! If not, boo!;
                if (loginSucceeded) {
                  navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl title="notifySignedIn()">notifySignedIn</a>(credential);
                  // Notify the user that signin succeeded! Do amazing, signed-in things!
                } else {
                  navigator.credentials.<a idl title="notifyFailedSignIn()">notifyFailedSignIn</a>(credential);
                  // Notify the user that signin failed, and fall back to the usual experience.
                }
              };

              xhr.send(credential.<a attribute>formData</a>);
            });
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-federated-signin">Federated Sign-in</h4>

    A website that supports <a>federated identity providers</a> can request
    credentials, and use them to kick off the sign-in flow for the user's
    chosen provider:

    <div class="example">
      <pre>
        if (!navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>) {
          // Sadness! Return early.
          return;
        }

        navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl title="request()">request</a>({
          "<a idl>federations</a>": [ "https://federation.com" ]
        }).then(
            function(credential) {
              if (!credential) {
                // The user either doesn't have credentials for this site, or
                // refused to share them. Insert some code here to show a basic
                // login form (or, ideally, do nothing, since this API should
                // really be progressive enhancement on top of an existing form).
                return;
              }

              if (credential instanceof <a idl>FederatedCredential</a>) {
                switch (credential.<a idl>federation</a>) {
                  // Do something specific for each supported federation.
                }
              } else {
                var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
                xhr.open("POST", "https://example.com/loginEndpoint");
                xhr.onreadystatechange = // Success handler from first example.
                xhr.send(credential.<a attribute>formData</a>);
              }
            });
      </pre>

      Note: This API is focused on a sign-in workflow, but could potentially
      be useful for federated <strong>sign-up</strong> flows as well.
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-post-signin">Post-sign-in Confirmation</h4>

    To ensure that credentials are persisted correctly, it may be useful for a
    website to tell the credential manager that sign-in succeeded.

    <div class="example">
      After navigation, the website won't (shouldn't) have access to the
      password, but can rely on the user agent to have retained a pending
      credential:

      <pre>
        if (navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>)
          navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl title="notifySignedIn()">notifySignedIn</a>(navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl>pending</a>);
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      If we haven't navigated (perhaps sign-in happened via XMLHttpRequest
      [[XMLHTTPREQUEST]]), then we can explain exactly which credentials were
      used:

      <pre>
        if (navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>) {
          navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl title="notifySignedIn()">notifySignedIn</a>(
            new <a idl>LocalCredential</a>("username", "hunter1")
          );
        }
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      If we're using a <a>federated identity provider</a>:

      <pre>
        if (navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>) {
          navigator.<a idl>credentials</a>.<a idl title="notifySignedIn()">notifySignedIn</a>(
            new <a idl>FederatedCredential</a>("username", "https://federation.com")
          );
        }
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h4 id="examples-sign-up">Sign-Up</h4>

    The "federated sign-in" mechanism can be reused for "sign-up" with no
    modifications: if the user has a credential from a supported federated
    identity provider, it could be offered to the user via the same request
    mechanism.

    <h4 id="examples-change-password">Change Password</h4>

    The "Local Sign-In" mechanism can be reused for "password change" with no
    modifications: if the user changes her credentials, the website can notify
    the user agent that she's successfully signed in with new credentials. The
    user agent can then update the credentials it stores.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="existing-solutions">
      Haven't we done this before? What about [<em>insert technology here</em>]?
    </h3>

    <h4 id="existing-solutions-browserid">BrowserID/Persona</h4>

    BrowserID is a proposal for an API which allows websites to request an
    assertion of a user's email address ownership. [[BROWSERID]]

    The API specified here does not attempt to assert the user's identity
    directly: it only provides a more direct interface to the user agent's
    <a>credential store</a>. Assertions about identity would still rely on
    <a>federated identity provider</a>'s particular SDKs and workflows.

    BrowserID is complementary to this API, and could be tacked onto the
    {{FederatedCredential}} flow at some point in the future. For example, a
    user who chooses a {{FederatedCredential}} whose origin supports
    BrowserID could perform the authentication steps in the background by
    passing the user's email address and public key to the relevant
    <a>identity provider</a>, and adding a new property to the
    {{FederatedCredential}} given back to the website which contains the
    signed certificate asserting the user's identity.

    This document doesn't specify any of that behavior, but is designed with
    it in mind: the immediate goal is to give websites more direct access to
    the user agent's existing credential manager, as federations are completely
    unsupported at the moment. Generating assertions is an obvious next step.
    See [[#future-work]] for other thoughts on the subject.

  <dl>
    <dt>
      <dfn export>Credentials</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A user authenticates herself to an <a>origin</a> by submitting a set of
      <strong>credentials</strong>. This typically consists of either a
      username/password pair, or a pointer out to a <a>federated identity
      provider</a> which will authenticate the user on her behalf.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <dfn export>Credential Store</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A <strong>credential store</strong> is an opaque storage mechanism which
      offers a user agent the ability to save, retrieve, and modify
      {{Credential}} objects.

      The implementation is vendor-specific, and the interface provided is not
      exposed to the web.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <dfn export local-title="zeroclick">Zeroclick Credential</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A {{Credential}} is said to be <strong>zeroclick</strong> for an origin
      if a user has chosen to allow it to be provided without further
      interaction when {{request()}} is called. Further discussion in
      [[#user-mediated-zeroclickization"]].
    </dd>

    <dt>
      <dfn export local-title="pending">Pending Credential</dfn>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A <strong>pending credential</strong> is a {{Credential}} object created
      automatically by the user agent when it believes that a user has
      signed-into, signed-up for, or changed credential on a website. For
      example, a pending credential may be created as a result of a successful
      form submission which contained a text field and a password field.

      Pending credentials are created in a vendor-specific way, using
      vendor-specific heuristics. They are retained for a <a>browsing
      context</a>, and MAY be retained across navigations, even cross-origin
      navigations (consider <code>accounts.example.com</code> redirecting to
      <code>webmail.example.com</code> upon successful sign-in).

      A <strong>federated identity provider</strong> is an entity which a
      website trusts to correctly authenticate a user, and which provides an
      API for that purpose. OAuth2 [[RFC6749]] is an example of such an API,

  can kick off some federated sign-in process (via Facebook Login, Firefox

  <h2 id="federations">Federated Identity Providers</h2>

  It would be useful indeed for a user agent to be able to identify which of the
  credentials it has stored for a user are tied to an <a>identity provider</a>.
  If such identification is possible, then a user who has stored credentials
  for (for example) Facebook might be able to reuse those credentials when
  attempting to sign into sites that support Facebook Login.

  To this end, <a>federated identity providers</a> SHOULD declare themselves
  as such by placing a <a>manifest</a> on the <a>origin</a> used to sign into
  the provider.

  <h3 id="identity-provider-manifest">Identity Provider Manifests</h3>

  An <dfn local-title="manifest">identity provider manifest</dfn> identifies an
  <a>origin</a> as belonging to a <a>federated identity provider</a>, and
  provides metadata that may be useful for user agents or other entities that
  wish to help users authenticate themselves via a third-party.

  <a>Federated identity providers</a> SHOULD declare themselves as such by
  placing a <a>manifest</a> at the following "well-known" location at the
  <a>origin</a> used to sign into the provider: [[!RFC5785]]

  <pre>
    /.well-known/identity-provider.manifest
  </pre>

  ISSUE: Register this URL as defined in
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785.html#section-5.1">section 5.1 of
  the RFC</a>, if we decide that this is a sane route to go down.

  The manifest MUST be served with a content type of
  <code>application/identity-provider-manifest</code>.

  ISSUE: Register the content type somewhere.

  When the credential manager stores a credential, it MAY asynchronously attempt
  to fetch this URL from the <a>origin</a> tied to the credential. If the
  attempt is successful, the credential could be flagged as being an identity
  provider. For detailed processing instructions, see the algorithm defined in
  [[#save-credential]].

  <div class="example">
    Users sign into Facebook at <code>https://www.facebook.com/login/</code>, and
    into Firefox at <code>https://accounts.firefox.com/signup</code>. To identify
    themselves as <a>identity providers</a>, Facebook would place a manifest at
    <code>https://www.facebook.com/.well-known/identity-provider.manifest</code>
    and Firefox at
    <code>https://accounts.firefox.com/.well-known/identity-provider.manifest</code>.
  </div>

  <h4 id="identity-provider-manifest-contents">Manifest Contents</h4>

  The manifest is a JSON document that contains metadata concerning a specific
  identity provider. It supports the following two member properties as defined
  in [[!MANIFEST]]:

  <ul>
    <li><code><a href="http://w3c.github.io/manifest/#name-member">name</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="http://w3c.github.io/manifest/#icons-member">icons</a></code></li>
  </ul>

  User agents MAY use these properties when rendering the <a>credential
  chooser</a> described in [[#user-mediated-selection]]. For example, the
  <a>federation</a>'s icon may be used to brand {{FederatedCredential}} items
  in the list in order to make their affiliations more apparent to users.

  <em>The remainder of this section is non-normative.</em>

  Currently, there's not a lot of value in actually putting any content into the
  manifest. However, there are a number of things that the user agent could do on
  the user's behalf in The Future™:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Provide some trusted UI for the authentication process; this might include
      a logo, brand-color, or name provided by the IDP.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hook the IDP up to an authenticator extension in the browser, or an app
      installed locally on Android. Could be done via a public key in the
      manifest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hard-code the authentication dance for some well-known, well-used
      providers. You could imagine built-in support for basic OAuth2, for
      instance, and hard-coded support for Facebook's, Firefox's, Google's,
      etc. variant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Indicate endpoints from which additional data about a user can be
      retrieved (name, avatar, etc).

      ISSUE: Spec this out in more detail. Perhaps make use of OpenID Connect?
    </li>
  </ul>

  ISSUE: What can we do to provide trusted UI for Facebook without at the same
  time enabling evil.com to present _the same_ UI?

  ISSUE: Other stuff?

  <h3 id="identifying-federations">Identifying Federations</h3>

  Every site should use the same identifier when referring to a specific
  <a>federated identity provider</a>. For example,
  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/v2.0">Facebook Login</a>
  shouldn't be "Facebook" and "Facebook Login" and "FB" and "FBL" and
  "Facebook.com" and so on. It should have a canonical identifier which everyone
  can make use of, as consistent identification makes it possible for user
  agents to be helpful.

  For consistency, federations passed into the APIs defined in this document
  (e.g. {{CredentialsContainer}}'s {{federations}} array, or
  {{FederatedCredential}}'s {{federation}} property) MUST be identified by the
  <a>ASCII serialization</a> of the origin the provider uses for sign in. That
  is, Facebook would be represented by <code>https://www.facebook.com</code>
  and Google by <code>https://accounts.google.com</code>.

  The ASCII serialization of an origin does <em>not</em> include a trailing
  U+002F SOLIDUS ("<code>/</code>"), but user agents SHOULD accept them
  silently: <code>https://accounts.google.com/</code> is clearly intended to
  be the same as <code>https://accounts.google.com</code>.

  <h2 id="user-mediation">User Mediation</h2>

  Exposing credential information to the web via an API has a number of
  potential impacts on user privacy. The user agent, therefore, MUST
  involve the user in a number of cases in order to ensure that she clearly
  understands what's going on, and with whom her credentials are being shared.

  <h3 id="user-mediated-storage">Storing and Updating Credentials</h3>

  Credential information is sensitive data, and users MUST remain in control
  of that information's storage. Inadvertent credential storage could, for
  instance, unexpectedly link a user's local profile on a particular device to
  a specific online persona. To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Credential information MUST NOT be stored or updated without explicit
      user consent. For example, the user agent could display a "Save this
      password?" dialog box to the user in response to each call to
      {{notifySignedIn()}}.
    </li>
    <li>
      User consent MAY be requested every time a credential is stored or
      updated, <strong>or</strong> the user agent MAY request a more persistent
      grant of consent which would apply to some or all subsequent API
      operations.

      For example, a user agent may offer an option to "Always save passwords",
      or "Always save password on this site".
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents SHOULD notify users when credentials are stored. This might
      take the form of an icon in the address bar, or some similar location.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST allow users to manually remove stored credentials. This
      functionality might be implemented as a settings page, or via interaction
      with a notification as described above.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="user-mediated-zeroclickization">Zeroclickization</h3>

  If a credential is considered <a>zeroclick</a> for an origin, it will be
  provided to pages on that origin without user interaction in response to
  a call to {{request()}}. The user will be signed-in to that origin,
  persistently, which might surprise her.

  If the user agent syncs the zeroclick state of a credential between
  devices, an origin could explicitly tie the devices together in a way which
  might surprise their owner.

  A user with multiple accounts for an origin might be surprised at which
  credential is considered zeroclick, leading to confusion when switching
  between accounts, or when logging out entirely.

  To mitigate the risk of surprise:

  <ol>
    <li>
      By default, {{Credential}} objects MUST NOT be considered <a>zeroclick</a>
      for the origin on which they're saved.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST NOT set the <code><a>[[isZeroClick]]</a></code> slot
      value to <code>true</code> without explicit user consent. For example, the
      <a>credential chooser</a> described in [[#user-mediated-selection]] could
      have a checkbox which the user could toggle to mark the selected
      credential as <a>zeroclick</a> for the origin.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST notify users when credentials are provided to an
      origin. This might take the form of an icon in the address bar, or some
      similar location.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents MUST allow users to manually de-zeroclickize credentials.
      This functionality might be implemented as a settings page, or via
      interaction with a notification as described above.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a user clears her browsing data for an origin (cookies, localStorage,
      and so on), the user agent MUST de-zeroclickize credentials for that origin
      by executing the algorithm defined in [[#dezeroclickize-origin]].
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="user-mediated-selection">Credential Selection</h3>

  When responding to a call to {{request()}} on an origin without <a>zeroclick
  credentials</a>, user agents MUST ask the user for permission to share
  credential information. This SHOULD take the form of a
  <dfn local-title="chooser">credential chooser</dfn> which presents the user
  with a list of credentials that are available for use on a site, allowing her
  to select one which should be provided to the website, or to reject the
  request entirely.

  The chooser interface SHOULD be implemented in such a way as to be
  distinguishable from UI which a website could produce. For example, the
  chooser might overlap the user agent's UI in some unspoofable way.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include an indication of the origin which is
  requesting credentials.

  The chooser interface SHOULD include all {{Credential}} objects associated
  with the origin that requested credentials. It MAY also include credentials
  associated with <a>federated identity providers</a> which the origin supports.
  For example, a credential associated with
  <code>https://www.facebook.com</code> might be suggested as a
  {{FederatedCredential}} on <code>https://example.com</code> if the latter
  lists the former as an accepted identity provider.

  Note: The credentials suggested in the chooser are not exposed to the web
  unless the user explicitly allows it. The user agent is therefore free to
  synthesize {{FederatedCredential}} objects for use in the chooser without
  risking a user's privacy.

  <em>The following image is an exceptionally non-normative mock:</em>

  <img src="./mock-chooser.png" alt="A mockup of what a chooser might look like.">

  User agents MAY internally associate information with each {{Credential}}
  object beyond the attributes specified in this document in order to enhance
  the utility of such a chooser. For example, favicons could help disambiguate
  identity providers, etc. Any additional information stored MUST not be
  exposed directly to the web.

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="security-cross-origin-leakage">Cross-origin Credential Leakage</h3>

  Credentials are sensitive information, and user agents need to exercise
  caution in determining when they can be safely shared with a website. The
  safest option is to restrict credential sharing to the exact origin on
  which they were saved. That is likely too restrictive for the web, however:
  consider sites which divide functionality into subdomains:
  <code>example.com</code> vs <code>admin.example.com</code>.

  As a compromise between annoying users, and securing their credentials, user
  agents:

  <ol>
    <li>
      MUST NOT share credentials between origins whose scheme components are
      not the same. That is: credentials saved on
      <code>https://example.com/</code> will never be available to
      <code>http://example.com/</code> via {{request()}}
    </li>
    <li>
      MAY use the Public Suffix List [[!PSL]] to determine the effective scope
      of a credential by comparing the <a>registerable domains</a> of the
      credential's <code>[[origin]]</code> with the origin in which
      {{request()}} is called. That is: credentials saved on
      <code>https://admin.example.com/</code> and
      <code>https://example.com/</code> MAY be offered to users when
      {{request()}} is called from <code>https://www.example.com/</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      MUST NOT offer <a>zeroclick</a> credentials to an origin in response
      to {{request()}} if the credential's origin is not an exact match for
      the calling origin. That is, <a>zeroclick</a> credentials for
      <code>https://example.com</code> would not be returned directly to
      <code>https://www.example.com</code>, but would be offered to the user
      via the chooser.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="security-origin-confusion">Origin Confusion</h3>

  If framed pages have access to the APIs defined here, it might be possible
  to confuse a user into granting access to credentials for an origin other
  than the <a>top-level browsing context</a>, which is the only security origin
  which users can reasonably be expected to understand.

  Therefore, <a>Nested browsing contexts</a> and other <a>JavaScript global
  environments</a> like Workers [[WORKERS]] cannot receive or store
  {{Credential}} objects; the user agent MUST reject promises generated by
  calls to {{request()}} and {{notifySignedIn()}} with a
  <code>SecurityError</code> when called from a context which is not a
  <a>top-level browsing context</a>.

  See the algorithms defined in [[#request-credential]] and [[#save-credential]]
  for details.

  ISSUE: Is this a meaningful restriction for Service Workers? Probably not.

  <h3 id="security-insecure-origins">Insecure Sites</h3>

  User agents MUST NOT expose credential information via the APIs defined here
  to <a>unsecured environments</a>. User agents MAY implement autofill
  mechanisms which store user credentials and fill sign-in forms on <a>insecure
  origins</a>, but those sites cannot be trusted to interact directly with the
  credential manager in any meaningful way.

  <h3 id="security-autocomplete-off">
    Reintroducing <code>autocomplete="off"</code>
  </h3>

  Some user agents have decided not to implement the
  <a element-attr>autocomplete</a></code> attribute in such a way as to
  prevent users from saving credentials. The APIs defined here SHOULD be
  implemented such that they don't provide an automatic way of bypassing that
  decision. Some of the requirements in [[#user-mediated-storage]] are in place
  for exactly this reason.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="privacy-timing-attacks">Timing Attacks</h3>

  If the user has no credentials for an origin, a call to {{request()}} will
  resolve very quickly indeed. A malicious website could distinguish between
  a user with no credentials and a user with credentials who chooses not to
  share them.

  This could allow a malicious website to determine if a user has credentials
  saved for particular federated identity providers by repeatedly calling
  {{request()}} with a single item in the {{federations}} array. The risk is
  mitigated by the fact that the user would, sooner or later, be prompted to
  provide credentials to the site, which would certainly raise her suspicions
  as to its behavior.

  ISSUE: Perhaps we should tie {{request()}} to a user gesture, or otherwise
  rate-limit calls to further mitigate the risk.

  <h3 id="privacy-chooser-leakage">Chooser Leakage</h3>

  If a user agent displayes images supplied by a website or federation (for
  example, if a {{Credential}}'s {{avatarURL}} is displayed), requests for these
  images MUST NOT be directly tied to instantiating the chooser in order to
  avoid leaking chooser usage. One option would be to fetch the images in the
  background when saving or updating a {{Credential}}, and to cache them for the
  lifetime of the {{Credential}}.

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The API defined here does the bare minimum to expose user agent's credential
  managers to the web, and allows the web to help those credential managers
  understand when <a>federated identity providers</a> are in use. The next
  logical step will be along the lines sketched in documents like [[WEB-LOGIN]]
  (and, to some extent, Mozilla's BrowserID [[BROWSERID]]).

  The user agent is in the unique position of being able to effectively mediate
  the relationship between users, identity providers, and websites. If the user
  agent can remove some of the risk and confusion associated with the typical
  authentication flows, users will be in a significantly better position than
  today.

  The natural way to expose this information is to extend the
  {{FederatedCredential}} interface with properties like authentication tokens,
  and the <a>manifest</a> format with properties which declare the
  authentication type which the provider supports.

  Baby steps.
