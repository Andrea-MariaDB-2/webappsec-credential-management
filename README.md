Credential Management
=====================

The spec is way more detailed than it should be at this stage; it's not
much more than my own opinions, mixed with a little bit of feedback from
folks on Google's identity team and password manager team.

I'm a little wary of putting it out like this, because of threads
like [this one](https://twitter.com/annevk/status/483975134093774848).
I'm not looking for a rubber-stamp, I will burn the whole thing down
if folks generally like the idea but disagree with the approach.

Feedback ever so welcome. :)
